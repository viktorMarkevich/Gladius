  Safari and responsive justified navs
  As of v7.0.1, Safari exhibits a bug in which resizing your browser horizontally causes rendering errors in the justified nav that are cleared upon refreshing. This bug is also shown in the justified nav example.

- content_for :sidebar_left, render( partial: 'shared/sidebar_left', locals: {title: 'News info', paragraph: 'top news'} )

- content_for :sidebar_right, render(:partial => 'shared/sidebar_right')
